3. **[00:00:09]** - Okay. I created this one, which is new
4. **[00:00:13]** - and then I had a concern about mm-hmm.
5. **[00:00:17]** - The others, I, I switched a few things off as well,
6. **[00:00:20]** - so I just needed your okay on that.
7. **[00:00:22]** - Okay. I've been using chat GPT,
8. **[00:00:24]** - which I don't know is the best option to guide me, but yeah.
9. **[00:00:29]** - Yeah, we can take a look.
10. **[00:00:30]** - So in terms of the traffic campaign,
11. **[00:00:33]** - it looks like you launched it really recently, right?
12. **[00:00:36]** - Yep, yep, yep, yep. Definitely yesterday.
13. **[00:00:40]** - Yeah, that makes sense. That's why it looks like it has no
14. **[00:00:42]** - data, but if we got a maximum we should have
15. **[00:00:47]** - a little bit of data so far.
16. **[00:00:49]** - Okay. So, and then 9 62,
17. **[00:00:53]** - lemme get my
18. **[00:00:55]** - conversion on the slide.

21. **[00:01:10]** - Okay. Thank you. All
22. **[00:01:15]** - Good. Okay, so that's around
23. **[00:01:16]** - 53 cents per page view.
24. **[00:01:19]** - It's not horrible. We typically like the,
25. **[00:01:21]** - like the traffic page view cost to be under like 20 cents,
26. **[00:01:26]** - which would be more aligned with this video right here.
27. **[00:01:30]** - Or, sorry, not this video, but this image.
28. **[00:01:32]** - So that would be, so this would be 12 cents per page view.
29. **[00:01:37]** - So yeah, I'd probably recommend like turning this one off,
30. **[00:01:39]** - uh, as well as this ad
31. **[00:01:41]** - because even if this gets like a, a page view,
32. **[00:01:44]** - it's gonna be like eight to nine rent R
33. **[00:01:47]** - or sorry, uh, the mm-hmm.
34. **[00:01:49]** - Czar, which would be, yeah, that would be like too much.
35. **[00:01:53]** - Basically it'd be like 50 to 70 cents.
36. **[00:01:57]** - **[Coach asks:]** [Are you aligned with that?](https://vimeo.com/1136519452/687cb0ed8f?share=copy&fl=sv&fe=ci#t=117s)

38. **[00:02:03]** - Yeah, so like this one right here
39. **[00:02:04]** - 'cause it's like too much of a page view cost
40. **[00:02:06]** - and then, oh, lemme go back.
41. **[00:02:12]** - And so anything basically above anything
42. **[00:02:17]** - above seven ZR
43. **[00:02:18]** - or it's gonna be like okay. Turned off basically.
44. **[00:02:21]** - Okay. Or if it's spent like this one has spent $7
45. **[00:02:24]** - or seven, uh,
46. **[00:02:26]** - but it hasn't actually generated a page view, which is Yeah.
47. **[00:02:30]** - Obviously ideal as well.
48. **[00:02:32]** - Okay. Like most, more
49. **[00:02:35]** - of the spend will be going here now to these two.

57. **[00:03:02]** - that means that it's in draft.
58. **[00:03:04]** - And then anything,
59. **[00:03:05]** - if you ever see like anything up here on the top right
60. **[00:03:07]** - where it says review and publish.
